kubernetes, scheduling, batching scheduling, network flow

TODOs:
1. revisit all TODOs commented among coding files
2. we need to revisit all the panic logic (log.Panic(...));
3. add mutex for scheduler functions, just like Firmament does;
4. add bool args to control the logic to handle migration and eviction conditions;
